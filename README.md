# My Personal Project: *Schedule Maker*

## What will the application do:
I intend to make a personal schedule maker, where you can make custom schedules to help organize your day.
Some of the features I want to include are:
- User Authentication and Authorization, so you can save and view your schedules securely
- Being able to create and have multiple schedules saved
- Being able to add and modify scheduleEvents in each schedule
- Being able to save important/recurring scheduleEvents
- Give scheduleEvents a name and a set time you can change at any time

## Who will use it: 
Anyone can use my schedule maker, including myself, 
friends, family, other students, etc. 

## Why is this project of interest to me:
This project is of interest to me because I always 
found that planning my day is quite important, however 
I have found that other schedule makers like notion or
calendar are hard to use, so I just use notes instead, 
which is not the most optimal choice. So, by making this project,
I am able to solve this problem for myself and maybe for others
who have this problem as well.
## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to **add** an scheduleEvent to a schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to delete scheduleEvents from my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to change the name of my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to see my schedule and all the scheduleEvents on it
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my schedule and modify it later
- As a user, I want to be able to load and access an old schedule I saved already

## Instructions for Grader

- clicking view schedule to see all scheduleEvent
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by adding an  
- scheduleEvent through add scheduleEvent button

## Phase 4: Task 3
If i were to refactor my code, I would definitely make a lot of changes to my ui classes, as right now all my code
for the ui is all in one class(ScheduleApp). Although when I was originally writing the code, doing it in one class 
made it easier for me to understand and process, it makes for really difficult debugging and makes it hard for 
other people to understand it as well. So, if I were to refactor it, I would definitely take the time to really
organize my ui into multiple classes, so that it's easier for others to understand and read, rather than just putting 
it all into one class.
