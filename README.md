# My Personal Project: *Schedule Maker*

## What will the application do:
I intend to make a personal schedule maker, where you can make custom schedules to help organize your day.
Some of the features I want to include are:
- User Authentication and Authorization, so you can save and view your schedules securely
- Being able to create and have multiple schedules saved
- Being able to add and modify events in each schedule
- Being able to save important/recurring events
- Give events a name and a set time you can change at any time

## Who will use it: 
Anyone can use my schedule maker, including myself, 
friends, family, other students, etc. 

## Why is this project of interest to me:
This project is of interest to me because I always 
found that planning my day is quite important, however 
I have found that other schedule makers like notion or
calendar are hard to use, so I just use notes instead, 
which is not the most optimal choice. So, by making this project,
I am able to solve this problem for myself and maybe for others
who have this problem as well.
## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to **add** an event to a schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to delete events from my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to change the name of my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to see my schedule and all the events on it
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my schedule and modify it later
- As a user, I want to be able to load and access an old schedule I saved already
- As a user, I want to be able to **modify the length of an event I already put on the schedule**
- As a user, I want to be able to **save recurring events to put on multiple schedules**
